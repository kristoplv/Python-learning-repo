Let's explore the magical land of collection data types (arrays) in Python.

There are four ways to collect data in Python:
  1) List - Allows duplicate members and is changeable, you can create a list using the list() function or using sqare brackets => my_list = ["Toyota", "BMW", "Mercedes"]
  2) Tuple - Allows duplicates, cannot be changed, is a bit faster than a list. To create a Tuple, use round brackets => my_tuple = ("Toyota", "BMW", "Mercedes")
  3) Set - Does not allow duplicates, set items cannot be changed but items can be added and removed. To create, use curly brackets my_set = {"Toyota", "BMW", "Mercedes"}
  4) Dictionary - No duplicate members, is changeable. To create a dictionary, we'll use curly brackets once again.
  my_dict = {
    "mark": "Toyota",
    "model": "Celica",
    "year": 2002
  }
  
In this excercise you'll create a list and print out the length of the list and all of it's values as well as individually print out every value in a list.
Make sure that your list has at least 3 values.
Then try to add more values into the list inside your program.
  
Create another list that only has integer values, for example my_list = [23, 4, 3, 14, 2]
Now find the smallest and biggest value in the list as well as the sum of all the values in the numbers list.
  
Useful functions:
  .append()
  len()
  min()
  max()
  sum()
