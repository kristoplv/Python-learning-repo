We'll start simple!
In this excercise you'll learn how to create variables and print them.

Create a variable named 'first_name' and a variable called 'last_name' and give them a value.
Now print them both separately and together in a single print.
Make the print prettier, adding text to it (for example: "Hello, my name is...")
Create a new variable called 'age' and print it.

#solution in "solutions" folder, named test_1_solution.
