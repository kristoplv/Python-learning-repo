Let's talk about the input() method.
Defining a variable and giving it the value of input() will let you give the variable a value of your own choice.
For example, name = input("Your name: ") will print "Your name" into the terminal and let you input a value to the name variable.

Lets do the same thing we did in task_1.
Define variables first_name, last_name, age and give them an input function.
Then print them to the terminal as was done in the first excercise.
