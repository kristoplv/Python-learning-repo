if statements.

One of the most powerful assets in programming are if/elif/else statements!
We use them to check if the values match our parameters, for example:
 I have a list of names and I want add a new name to the list.
 But if the name is already on the list, i want to print a corresponding message
 and if the name isn't in the list, i'll add it and print out a message.
 
 my_list = ["John", "Gary", "Marcus", "Taylor"]
 new_name = input("new name: ")
 
 if new_name in my_list:
    print("That name is already in the list!")
 else:
    my_list.append(new_name)
    print(new_name, "added to the list")
    print(my_list)
 
A perfect example of using an if/else statement!

Now for the excercise.
Create a list of numbers that has at least 5 values. Use the input method to add a new number. The number must be: bigger than the smallest value in the list,
smaller than the biggest number in the list and the number cannot be a number that is already in the list.

You should use the 'greater-than, smaller-than' signs for this exercise!
You should also pass the new number as an integer: new_nr = int(input("new number: ")) because the input() function passes values as a string by default :)
