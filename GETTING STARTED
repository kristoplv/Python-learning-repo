Here's what you'll need to start learning Python:
  
  1)Download and install python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
  Make sure you choose to create a path for windows.
  
  2) Choose an IDE where you'll create most of your code! Great Python IDEs are: PyCharm community/pro, Visual Studio Code by Microsoft, Notepad++, Thonny IDE (useful if
  you want to create programs for raspberry products using MicroPython).
  
  3) Can-do attitude will come in handy!
  
But most importantly, dont give up! Programming is not an easy skill to learn and there will be times
where you just want to smash in your keyboard because of a Synthax error (been there, done that). Try
to stay positive and don't let errors discourage you. You can do it!
